# Presentation

## Points to Cover

1. Purpose of studying trait evolution
2. Patterns of trait evolution
3. Major models
	* Brownian Motion
	* Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
4. What we simulated
5. How we simulated
	* Parameters
6. Results
	* Effect of bottleneck on variance
	* Effect of multiple bottlenecks on variance

## Other Observations

1. Very early bottleneck --> rate not as affected
	* disparification very fast initially
	* probably so early that the small variance still can quickly widen
2. Very late bottleneck --> rate not as affected
	* our model is like OU
	* variation slows
	* appears to be soft bounds 
	* bottleneck trims rarer variants from edges
	* quickly returns to "normal"
