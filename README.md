# Purpose

To examine the effects of population bottlenecks on trait evolution.

# Data

Pre-simulated data used in the slides are available in the Downloads section <https://github.com/jonchang/brownian-bottlenecks/downloads>

# Code

* `sim_library.R` calculates the simulation data. `source("sim.library.R")`
* `run_simulations.R` drives the simulation calculation and puts everything in the right directories.
* `create_brownian_example_plots.R` generates the plots used to illustrate Brownian motion.
* `create_single_plot.R` generates a single plot that illustrates the effects of a population bottleneck in one of our replicated simulation runs.
