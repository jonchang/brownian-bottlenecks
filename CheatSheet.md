# Cheat Sheet

## Points about Statistical Tests
* Kurtosis
    * Kurtosis of 3 = Normal Distribution
    * Kurtosis of 1.8 = Uniform Distribution
    * Kurtosis > 3 = peaked distribution
* Skewness
    * Skewness of 0 = Normal Distribution
    * Skewness > 0 = Positive Skew/Skewed Right
    * Skewness < 0 = Negative Skew/Skewed Left
    
## To Consider    
* Diploidy
    * Recomb UP, LD D, Var D
    * B/c rate slower, recovery time might actually be longer.
    
## How is BM, OU, AC/DC, etc. used?
* Used to estimate how traits are evolving
* Suggests different mechanisms
* Usually a statistic that tells us how likely we are to get the data with that model helps us.
    * Then use that statistic to make another statistic called AIC
    * Helps us choose which one model is more likely
